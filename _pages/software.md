Check more on my [GitHub](https://github.com/x-zang).


- [Amaranth](https://github.com/Shao-Group/amaranth) is a transcript assembler optimized for single-cell RNA-seq.

- [TENNIS](https://github.com/Shao-Group/TENNIS) is an algorithm that can identify and augment missing isoforms from transcriptome annotations. It is based on isoform evolution and does not require additional data input, e.g. RNA-Seq.

- [Anchorage](https://github.com/Shao-Group/anchorage) is a synthetic long read (SLR) assembler for anchor-labelled SLR data. It is specifically robust to sequencing artifacts and errors under high sequencing depth.

- [Altai](https://github.com/Shao-Group/altai) is an allele-specific transcript assembler.
