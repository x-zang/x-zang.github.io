Hi! I'm Carl. I am a postdoc fellow in the Center for Computational and Genomic Medicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, supervised by [Dr. Yi Xing](https://xinglab.org/people/yi-xing/). I received my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics & Genomics from The Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Dr. Mingfu Shao](https://sites.psu.edu/mxs2589/about-pi/). Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained my B.S. in Cell & Molecular Biology with First Class Honors from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

My research is on developing computational methods to advance transcriptome analysis and address challenges in RNA sequencing and assembly. My research integrates algorithms, machine learning, and biological insights to investigate problems such as alternative splicing, allele-specific expression, and transcript assembly using various sequencing technologies.
